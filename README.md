# Hattrick_Analysis
Set of Python Programs to help analyze fantasy football (also known as Soccer). 

The first program analyzes each player in every possible position.

It returns an excel sheet that shows the total score of that particular player.


*Another idea is to take the layout of the last match and analyze it in the same way (assuming no training has taken place).
This will also allow me to learn what the system calls each position.
